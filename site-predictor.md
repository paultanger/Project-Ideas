# Capstone 2 project ideas

1. campsite predict from sat images or other data from ioverlander
http://ioverlander.com/countries/places_by_country

* focus on US first (~ 8000 sites)
* some are "camping", some are established sites with showers etc
* maybe try to classify sites based on sat images? (could download adjacent sat tile as "non site" data)
* or use some of the other data columns to do classification or clustering for recommendations?
* There is a text field I could do some NLP on ("Description").  An example of this is:

'Hammer site. Lots of places for vehicle or tent camping with good views.\n\nThree pools, the one in the center can be somewhat adjusted temperature wise.\n\nRoads leading to it are 2wd dirt roads and should be easy unless wet.'
